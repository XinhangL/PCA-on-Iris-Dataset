# 🌸 PCA Dimensionality Reduction on Iris Dataset

This notebook demonstrates how to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the Iris dataset and visualize it in two dimensions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Iris flower dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
- **Goal**: Reduce features from 4D to 2D while retaining 98% of variance
- **Techniques**: PCA for feature reduction, scatter plot visualization

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- PCA decomposition using `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`
- Variance ratio analysis and component selection
- Comparison of data before and after PCA transformation
- Cluster visualization of three flower classes in 2D space
